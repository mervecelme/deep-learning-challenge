## Deep Learning Challenge: AlphabetSoupCharity

Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, aims to make data-driven decisions in selecting funding applicants with the highest chance of success. This project involves developing a binary classifier using deep learning techniques to predict the effectiveness of funding based on various organization features.

## Instructions:
Preprocess Data: Clean and encode data, split into features and targets, and scale.

Compile, Train, and Evaluate Model: Design, train, and evaluate a neural network model to predict funding effectiveness.

Optimize Model: Enhance model performance by adjusting data, architecture, and training parameters.

Write Report: Summarize analysis, discuss model architecture, performance, and optimization steps.

## Dataset Overview:
charity_data.csv: Contains information on organizations funded by Alphabet Soup, including application type, affiliation, classification, income amount, and funding effectiveness.

## Model Development:
The model predicts whether an organization's funding was effective based on its characteristics.

Data preprocessing includes encoding categorical variables and scaling features.

Neural network architecture is designed using TensorFlow and Keras, with multiple hidden layers and appropriate activation functions.

The model is trained, evaluated, and optimized to achieve high accuracy.
